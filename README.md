# palindrome
project makes in C

A palindrome is a word or a number which reads the same backward or forward (that is for numbers, num-bers invariant when reversed).An-iteration turnover palindrome is a number which leads to a palindrome after n iterations of the following procedure:
1.reverse the number,
2.add both the number and its reversal to obtain a new number,
3.iterate from the first step until you get a palindromic number.
For instance:
	121 is a 0-iteration turnover palindrome,
	123 is a 1-iteration turnover palindrome and
	4782 is a 3-iteration turnover palindrome.
The goal of this project is to find such iterated reversal palindromes, and the smallest number of iterations,in order to get a palindromic number, given the constraints on this number of iterations.

EXEMPLE :

	USAGE./palindrome -n number -p palindrome [-b base] [-imin i] [-imax i]
DESCRIPTION
	-n n      integer to be transformed (>=0)
	-p pal    palindromic number to be obtained (incompatible with the -noption) (>=0)
	if defined, all fitting values of n will be output
	-b base   base in which the procedure will be executed (1<b<=10) [def: 10]
	-imin i   minimum number of iterations, included (>=0) [def: 0]
	-imax i   maximum number of iterations, included (>=0) [def: 100]
